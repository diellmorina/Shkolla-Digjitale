        PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously titled PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a 2017 battle royale video game published by Krafton, 
        and developed by Krafton's PUBG Studios. The game, which was inspired by the Japanese film Battle Royale (2000),
         is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games,
         and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction.
         Played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island where they are tasked to scavenge for weapons 
         and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the 
        game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever-tightening space to force encounters.
